          <h2>Other Interests</h2>
          <p>I enjoy the outdoors, my whole childhood I was either hiking or in the woods near our house. Computers came into my life a little later on, and I quickly gained a liking for them. Sketching has also become something I do often, drawing the human body really got me into sketching even more.</p>
